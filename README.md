# WVSU-NASA-2018
This project contains code for a Raspberry Pi and an external microcontroller. The Raspberry Pi will process images captured from a Michelson Interferometer and communicate with the microcontroller and transmit data over an external telemetry line. The microcontroller code will monitor and manage geiger circuits and an IMU. The first flight will be late 2018 as part of NASA's RockSat-X.

The `interferometer` folder can be built with GNU make, and the `microcontroller` folder can be built with the Arduino IDE.
